# Mod-Workshop

This is a utility made by me in 2008 which enables you to modify graphics files of the game Age of Empires 2- Age of Kings (Conquerors ).

Quite outdated now (2016).. The turtle pack is the new software which serves the purpose of modding in AOK game engine.

However it should still work. Uploading here just because this was my first big open source project.
