installmaul is what your folder should look like after running the install script generator
In the 'before' folder, the star wars SLP has been deleted to conserve space.
maulscript.nsi -> what I got from the script generator
Darth Maul -> Zip file containing mod installer, campaign and sound file. Install the mod and copy the cpx into campaign folder, and the sound into sound/scenario folder.
Enjoy!
